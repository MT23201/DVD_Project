OAI-222 (STATIC CMOS) Standard Cell Design 
                                                                                                        
Implementation of standard cell static cmos OAI-222 complex and non-complex gate, 
schematic in Xschem, simulations in NgSpice, layout and DRC in Magic, LVS clean with 
Netgen using open source Skywater 130nm PDK. Brief comparison of Power, Performance 
and Area under different PVT conditions between complex and non-complex.
